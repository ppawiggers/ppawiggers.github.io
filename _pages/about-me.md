My name is Peter Wiggers (Amsterdam, The Netherlands) and I've been a freelance cloud consultant (_design &amp; build_) since 2015. I specialize in the Google Cloud Platform and Kubernetes.

What I do:

- Design GCP infrastructure architecture from scratch (organization, projects, IAM, networking, hybrid connectivity, GKE, etc.)
- Build what I designed (using Terraform boilerplates and CI/CD pipelines)
- Automate processes (builds, tests, configuration)
- Lead DevOps teams
- Present at conferences

If you want to hire me, please drop me a line at peter@bitlayer.nl.
